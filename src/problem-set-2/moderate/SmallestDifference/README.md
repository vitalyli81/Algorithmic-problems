## 16.6 Smallest Difference:

Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.

**Examples :**

```
Input : A[] = {l, 3, 15, 11, 2}
        B[] = {23, 127, 235, 19, 8}
Output : 3
That is, the pair (11, 8)

Input : A[] = {l0, 5, 40}
        B[] = {50, 90, 80}
Output : 10
That is, the pair (40, 50)
```
